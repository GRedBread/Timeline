            <p id="description">Bloons Tower Defense (BTD) is a popular tower defense game series where players defend against waves of attacking bloons (balloons) by strategically placing various types of towers along a path. Each tower has different abilities, costs, and upgrade paths, and they pop bloons when they are in range. The goal is to prevent the bloons from reaching the end of the track.</p>
